# Regex Tutorial: Matching an E-mail Address

What does "regex" mean? It's short for "regular expression" which in programming or computer science is used to define a search pattern in text form (or rather, in the form of a string.) Even that definition can cause some pause, so I'll elaborate further to say that these expressions are capable of matching a portion of a string and therefore validating that a given input matches a specified criteria.

## Summary

So... what does a regular expression look like? 

``` /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/ ```

The one we'll be talking about today is the regular expression that defines the search pattern for a "valid" e-mail address. Remember: these expressions validate that a given input matches a specified criteria. Let's learn how!
